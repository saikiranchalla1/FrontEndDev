===================================================

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the <html> tag.

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.

In HTML 4.01, the <!DOCTYPE> declaration refers to a DTD, because HTML 4.01 was based on SGML. The DTD specifies the rules for the markup language, so that the browsers render the content correctly.

HTML5 is not based on SGML, and therefore does not require a reference to a DTD.

Common DOCTYPE Declarations
---------------------------

HTML 5
<!DOCTYPE html>


HTML 4.01 Strict
This DTD contains all HTML elements and attributes, but does NOT INCLUDE presentational or deprecated elements (like font). Framesets are not allowed.
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">


HTML 4.01 Transitional
This DTD contains all HTML elements and attributes, INCLUDING presentational and deprecated elements (like font). Framesets are not allowed.
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">

HTML 4.01 Frameset
This DTD is equal to HTML 4.01 Transitional, but allows the use of frameset content.
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Frameset//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/frameset.dtd">


XHTML 1.0 Strict
This DTD contains all HTML elements and attributes, but does NOT INCLUDE presentational or deprecated elements (like font). Framesets are not allowed. The markup must also be written as well-formed XML.
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">


XHTML 1.0 Transitional
This DTD contains all HTML elements and attributes, INCLUDING presentational and deprecated elements (like font). Framesets are not allowed. The markup must also be written as well-formed XML.
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">


XHTML 1.0 Frameset
This DTD is equal to XHTML 1.0 Transitional, but allows the use of frameset content.
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Frameset//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-frameset.dtd">


XHTML 1.1
This DTD is equal to XHTML 1.0 Strict, but allows you to add modules (for example to provide ruby support for East-Asian languages).
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">


================================================

Block-level Elements:

	A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up 
	the full width available (stretches out to the left and right 
	as far as it can).

	The <div> element is a block-level element.

	Examples of block-level elements:

	<div>
	<h1> - <h6>
	<p>
	<form>


Inline Elements:

	An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up 
	as much width as necessary.

	This is an inline <span> element inside a paragraph.

	Examples of inline elements:

	<span>
	<a>
	<img>



CSS groups HTML elements into two categories

1)
Replaced Element:

	An element whose content is outside the scope of the CSS formatting model, 
	such as an image, embedded document, or applet. For example, the content 
	of the HTML IMG element is often replaced by the image that its "src" 
	attribute designates. Replaced elements often have intrinsic dimensions: 
	an intrinsic width, an intrinsic height, and an intrinsic ratio. For 
	example, a bitmap image has an intrinsic width and an intrinsic height 
	specified in absolute units (from which the intrinsic ratio can obviously 
	be determined). On the other hand, other documents may not have any 
	intrinsic dimensions (for example, a blank HTML document).

	User agents may consider a replaced element to not have any intrinsic 
	dimensions if it is believed that those dimensions could leak sensitive 
	information to a third party. For example, if an HTML document changed 
	intrinsic size depending on the user's bank balance, then the UA might 
	want to act as if that resource had no intrinsic dimensions.

	The content of replaced elements is not considered in the CSS rendering model.

	Some HTML elements do not have content in between opening and closing tags. 
	For example:
		<img src="eightball.gif">  or  <input type="reset">
	The img and input elements do not have separate closing tags and therefore 
	do not have any content. These elements use attributes to specify external 
	resources to display. In the example above, the img element specifies an 
	image to display and the input element specifies a button. You can say that 
	their contents are replaced by external resources.

2) 
Non-replaced element:
	Most HTML elements have an opening tag, a closing tag, and content in between
	the two tags. 
	For example:
		<div>content</div>  or  <p>content</p>
	The div and p elements are called non-replaced elements because their content
	is actually displayed. It is not replaced with something else.
